# UFOs
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to provide a webpage that allowed users to filter multiple criteria at one time. It gives a more in depth experience for users. Besides the date, UFO sightings can be filtered by location, city, state and country, and shape. 

## Results
Users are welcomed with an opening paragraph that goes into what may be out in the universe and how we could possibly not be alone. When they scroll down, there are boxes they can use as filters. Users have the ability to use just one or their desired amount to find sightings of UFO they are searching for.

As shown above, users can enter information and see results that match as fit description. 

## Summary
I enjoyed the webpage, but I believe there is room for improvement. 
My three recomendations are:
1. After the date is entered as a filter, it should show results close to that specific one. It is easy to get dates mixed up and allows for a higher percentage of results back for the users.
2. I would add a filter for color as that seems as a popular description for sights.
3. The webpage should work in a section to display newly added sights to keep users coming back.
